Here is what you have to do to use Robbo millenium levels in Gnu Robbo

1. buy original Robbo Millenium (I suppose the levels are copyrighted)
2. compile lvdump_millenium.c (gcc lvdump_millenium.c -o lvdump_millenium)
3. use Wine (if you run Linux) to install Robbo Millenium
4. localise Caves.dta and Caves2.dta files, where you had install Robbo
5. use something like that to convert levels:
    for x in `seq 1 60` ; do lvdump_millenium -l $x -a "avalon" -o 0 -f Caves.dta ; done >millenium1.dat
    for x in `seq 1 76` ; do lvdump_millenium -l $x -a "avalon" -o 0 -f Caves2.dta ; done >millenium2.dat
6. modify the dat files - add headers like:
    [name]
    Millenium1
    [last_level]
    60
and
    [name]
    Millenium2
    [last_level]
    76
7. copy these to your levels location of your gnurobbo installation
8. enjoy:)

There are 4 new objects. First of all, there are vertical magnets (2 objects),
then there is "stop" sign - it blocks magnets, guns, but does nothing more, it
disappears, when robbo steps on it.
The other is "radioactive field" sign - blocks magnets, guns, and kills roobo, when 
it steps on it.
