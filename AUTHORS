The original ATARI XE/XL Robbo game that GNU Robbo is based upon.

============================================================

The game was originally created in 1989 by Janusz Pelc and LK Avalon
and was working on ATARI XE/XL. I missed this game so much so I decided
to start my own project which would be a reimplementation of the game.
It was not so easy because all I had was only a working game. I had no
code or algorithms.

Another reason was that I'd like to write a program based on the SDL
library. This was my first project that uses SDL.

Additionally I am also responsible for the Win32 port.

=============================================

In 2005 I ported this to the Sharp Zaurus and converted some more
levels. Arkadiusz Lipiec included me as a developer on the GNU Robbo
Sourceforge project and now I've incorporated my additional work
into this game. I also decided to continue developing the project to a
more complete level with the inclusion of in-game help, options, new
graphics, a demo mode and reconfigurable controls.

Additionally I am also responsible for the Sharp Zaurus and GP2X ports.

============================================

neurocyp joined the GNU Robbo team in October 2009 and greatly enhanced
it by implementing sound and music, converting many more level packs
and fine tuning compatibility with the original Atari Robbo game.

Bombel joined the GNU Robbo team in October 2009 and introduced code to
enable a Sony PlayStation PSP port.
