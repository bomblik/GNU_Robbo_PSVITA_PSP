-----------------------------------------------------------------------

[-] - Thunor: Moved to SF feature requests:
	I think that starting screen has to be updated to more modern.
	Maybe some nice-looking image, and reimplementation of text area
	(more information has to be put there).
[-] - Thunor: Moved to SF feature requests:
	Also option navigation windows are not certain for some users
	(esp. music and skins options are hard to find first time...)
[-] - Thunor: Moved to SF feature requests:
	gamepad handling with SDL (not joystick but similar ;)
[p] - Creator for manually edit and testing the planets by user i.e. a
	level editor. Thunor: This would be  very useful for creating
	GPL level packs that are not converted from the Atari Robbo game.
	Although the engine, the new Tronic skin (and the forthcoming
	sounds) are truly original content, the levels are not and this
	may disuade certain distros and users from playing GNU Robbo.
[p] - Sound and sound effects. 
	Most of the sound effects present.
	User can enable/disable sound in the options menu.
	User can also set sound effects volume in the options menu.
	It is possible to set the sound efx volume using +/- keys.
	Sound skins are also supported, now an user can set up
	soundskin variable in the skin definition (check oily skin).
	I think it would be nice to have also custom music playing,
	but it takes time to find some apropriate and free content.
[-] - Thunor: Moved to SF bug tracker:
	The exploding bomb animation is slightly different in the Atari
	Robbo. There seems to be some randomness to the actual animation
	frames being used. This would be possible with GNU Robbo as
	when a BIG_BOOM object is created it has an array of animation
	frames that could be modified so that explosions look more
	chaotic. It does look as though the exploding bomb animation is
	different to the exploding targets around a bomb.
	The atari800 is useful for creating screenshots by pressing F10
	rapidly.
[-] - Thunor: Moved to SF feature requests:
	Research making objects transit tiles in smaller units. Robbo
	moves in 4 frames, so at 32x32 that would be 4x8px units and
	would look much smoother. Actually everything that moves uses
	a delay of 4. This could be in Options with the sensible flags.
	This was a suggestion from a user via a forum. Whether it's worth
	implementing is another matter.
[p] - Once 0.64 is out, all the level packs will need playtesting as
	only some of the new ones have been tested, and some of the object
	behaviours have been changed which could affect the playability
	and completability of some levels.
	[x] Robbo97 levels are not completable as there's no capsule :-
		[x] 7  - I think original expected capsule from question mark.
		[x] 22 - Missing from dump (several capsules behind doors).
		[x] 24 - Was missing from dump.
		[x] 25 - Was missing from dump.
		[x] 48 - I think original expected capsule from question mark.
		[x] 67 - Was missing from dump.
	[-] Thunor: Moved to SF bug tracker:
		Robbo97:17 is impossible from the very start.
[-] - Thunor: Moved to SF feature requests:
	I think it would be a good idea in the future to grade the level
	packs because there is no way to know which packs are suitable for
	children, adults or Mensa members. It would be nice to show this
	on-screen when selecting level packs, but at the moment there is no
	more room for this. This of course will change if and when the main
	screen is redesigned. Maybe add a tag to level packs "[difficulty]".
[x] - Note that the designer won't be using ROB and so the following text
	items are now redundant (I've disabled the controls as they may be
	used later so it's best not to remove the text yet) :-
	[-] - txt_Scroll_Up				[x]en [-]de [x]pl [-]sk [-]sv [-]ru
	[-] - txt_Scroll_Down			[x]en [-]de [-]pl [-]sk [-]sv [-]ru
	[-] - txt_Simulated_Pointer		[x]en [-]de [x]pl [-]sk [-]sv [x]ru
	[-] - txt_Move_Up_Right			[x]en [-]de [x]pl [-]sk [-]sv [x]ru
	[-] - txt_Move_Up_Left			[x]en [-]de [x]pl [-]sk [-]sv [x]ru
	[-] - txt_Move_Down_Right		[x]en [-]de [x]pl [-]sk [-]sv [x]ru
	[-] - txt_Move_Down_Left		[x]en [-]de [x]pl [-]sk [-]sv [x]ru
[x] - Now that the designer won't be using ROB, these controls are
	redundant and can be removed from Options (they would have been
	used to control a simulated pointer for handhelds that don't have
	a touchscreen) :-
	[-] Move Up-Right   (disabled, maybe used later, maybe not)
	[-] Move Down-Right (disabled, maybe used later, maybe not)
	[-] Move Down-Left  (disabled, maybe used later, maybe not)
	[-] Move Up-Left    (disabled, maybe used later, maybe not)
	[-] Move Up-Right   (disabled, maybe used later, maybe not)
[x] - Designer :-
	Note that the designer won't be using ROB and so the simulated
	pointer is redundant.
	[x] ROB.
	[x] Add "Toggle Designer" to Options.
	[x] Add Designer to Intro Screen menu.
	[x] Implement a simulated pointer for devices with no pointer.
		Add to Options :-
		[-] Simulated Pointer < { Disabled | Enabled } >
		[-] Speed Low < 4px >
		[-] Speed High < 8px >
		[-] Speed Threshold < 6 >
[x] - Pixmap font: Add Russian characters.
[x] - Tronic skin:
	[x] Theme new Millenium icons.
	[x] Add small background images.
	[x] Update level_colour_overrides for new levels to vary somewhat.
[x] - Loose ends that need tidying-up before next 0.64 release :-
	[x] - Why isn't sound enabled by default?
	[x] - Why is volume 0 by default? Maybe 30 is a good starting vol.
	[-] - I noticed that data/sounds/skins/sounds_oily.dat would be
		better named oily.dat to match the graphical skin name. It's
		not show-stopping, but the "sounds_" prefix is unnecessary.
	[x] - Check that Restore Default Controls is doing what it should.
	[x] - Review Options entries and texts.
	[x] - Tronic: Override (generally) level colours in skinrc as many
		are too bright and some too dark.
	[x] - In Options: Sound < 0/1 > is not very human readable. As to
		distinguish it with possible Music options, I recommend
		Sound FX < Disabled/Enabled >   [txt_Sound_FX]
		Sound FX Volume < 0-128 >       [txt_Sound_FX_Volume]
	[x] - Oily: [about] info really needs updating because it's more
		now than just a Gimped copy of Original. This sells it better:-
		"A skin based on the original Atari Robbo and Robbo
		Millenium graphics applied with an oily effect.
		Includes level background image and Oily soundskin."
	[x] - Cannot load PNG image ./data//skins/*/background.png is
		annoying because it's optional. Only display warning for files
		that aren't background.png.
	[x] - Home and End don't work on the sound options.
	[x] - Fix Sound and volume "<" ">" colour change bugs.
	[x] - Need to identify the licences of the sounds (Free Sound
		Project says Creative Commons but which one) and place a copy
		of the licence into the root folder. UPDATE: All the sounds
		are http://creativecommons.org/licenses/sampling+/1.0/ but
		the authors may need to be attributed for their work. Which
		authors? Ask neurocyp. GOT INFO: Will update in morning.
	[X] - 017-R653924: unplayable - rmoved this level
	[X] - 002-ROBBOXI: robbo11.dat level 2 not found.- fixed lvldump, and converted the levels
	[x] - ROBBO V: 87, 88 missing, or maybe incorrect level count.
	[x] - ROBBO II: 89, 90 missing, or maybe incorrect level count.
	[x] - 039-ROBBO III: "F**K YOU" written within the map although it
		can't be viewed unless maximising the screen and viewport.
	[x] - Sound: segfaults (for me) when repeatedly opening and closing
		audio. My version of SDL_mixer-1.2.7 may not be so happy about
		(or may not even support) repeatedly calling Mix_OpenAudio and
		Mix_CloseAudio as these are initialising and unloading the
		library and resources. In the SDL_mixer example sdlwav-2.c
		Mix_OpenAudio is executed at the start and Mix_CloseAudio is
		executed at the end, just before SDL is shutdown. As I have
		60+ open source games on my computer and I haven't knowingly
		experienced this issue before, I am assuming that this is how
		other developers are using SDL_mixer. The trouble is GNU Robbo
		runs (or did run) on devices with older SDL_mixer libraries and
		so sound is going to have to be reorganised to make it more
		compatible. For the record :-
		neurocyp is using SDL_mixer 1.2.8
		I (Thunor) am using 1.2.7
		Willem-Jan's Nokia N8x0 (OS2008) Port is using 1.2.6
		My GPH GP2X F100 uses 1.2.6
		My Sharp Zaurus uses 1.2.5
	[x] - RobboI: [colour]s are missing and there's no default set.
	[x] - RobboIV: [colour]s are missing and there's no default set.
	[x] - RobboXI: [colour]s are missing and there's no default set.
	[x] - RobboXII: [colour]s are missing and there's no default set.
	[x] - RobboXIII: [colour]s are missing and there's no default set.
	[x] - Robbo2001: [colour]s are missing for levels 3, 4 and 6 and
		there's no default set.
	[x] - ROBBO 98: unrecognised object " " "1" "5"
	[x] - Demos: robboviii.dat is no more; find levels and fix: I found
		the levels in robbo03.dat.
	[x] - Level filenames: would be sensible not to use UPPERCASE
		because of the SD cards on Linux devices.
	[x] - Level pack [name]s: should remove spaces, invalid characters
		and standardise.
	[x] - Level pack [name]s: is "Robb0 IV" valid?
	[x] - ROBBO IV: unrecognised object "2" "c" " "
	[x] - ROBBO 2009: unrecognised object
	[x] - ROBBO 97: unrecognised object "2" "c" " " "f" "1" "5"
	[x] - ROBBO B: level count is wrong
	[x] - ROBBO I: unrecognised object "2" "c" " "
	[x] - ROBBO II: unrecognised object "2" "c" " " "f" "1" "5"
	[x] - 033-ROBBO III: Attributed to J&P Wardzynscy but was in fact
		made by myself (Thunor) and was one of my level pack bonus
		endings. I think it was the end of robboviii.dat which is
		why it's now in robbo03.dat.
	[x] - ROBBO V: unrecognised object "2" "c" " "
	[x] - ROBBO VIII: Maybe in authorline "adn" should be "and"?
	[x] - Unrecognised object "+" is a life which GNU Robbo no longer
		supports and so I have stopped these error messages.
[x] - Port the levels from RobboX and RobboXI.
[x] - Pointer Controls :-
	[x] Design some themed toolbar icons.
	[x] End Screen: only the toolbar exit button is visible.
	[x] There needs to be a restart button.
		There does not appear to be a method of detecting the
		availability of a mouse/stylus within SDL. Therefore these
		options will be available on all devices :-
	[x] Primary Click		Ptr:BtnLeft			<-->
	[x] System Pointer < { Disabled | Enabled } >
	[x] The pointer controls will only be available in game_on mode
		as elsewhere there will be hittable rectangles (hotspots) to
		operate the menus. The system pointer only will be available
		and visible if selected in Options.
	[x] There should be a parent toolbar with icons for many required
		tasks.
[x] - Options really needs an overhaul now as it's become unwieldly.
[x] - Create a BMP font and remove libSDL_ttf for the Sharp Zaurus. The
	problem with this is that it will make internationalisation a
	bit more complicated as a UTF-8 bitmap could be extensive. I'll
	seperate the text first and then worry about this later. The
	benefits are more control over graphical positioning, and wider
	compatibility.
[x] - Research saving rcfile on new level start for GP2X. GP2X can run
	out of battery power, therefore progress doesn't get saved.
[x] - Dump vm usage to the console, not to a file in the binary folder.
[x] - Update Sourceforge website HTML, or use new wiki instead.
[x] - 0.60 release. Win32 package and rc1 source releases.
[x] - Better graphics (and bigger)... (bigger as for now completed)
	Tronic skin: [x] BEAR_B, [x] BIRD and [x] BUTTERFLY to finish.
[x] - Set some level colour overrides for the Tronic skin if needed for
	all the level packs so far.
[x] - Re-do the demos across all packs. Modify demo_mode() to store and
	select packs based on their name, not their level_packs index.
[x] - Fix set_video_mode() to not fall back to the same mode, or to
	attempt to set hi-res on the GP2X. FIXED: It's designed to try
	the defaults so leave that. Have forced GP2X to 320x240 -ts 16.
[-] - XML format for levels (and maybe separate files would be better)
	Thunor: The levels are seperated into packs. Their format is
	fine in my opinion and easier to understand than looking at raw
	XML. I think this would be a lot of work for little reward.
[-] - Better scrolling (now is SCROLL_RATE jumping - not working perfect)
	Thunor: To achieve smoother scrolling is difficult because the
	basic unit of the game is the size of the tiles (field_size)
	and even if you reduce scroll_rate, show_game_area only draws in
	tile units.
[x] - Seperate the text from the code for easy internationalisation.
	UPDATE: Did some research: GNU/Linux and C is good-to-go for
	UTF-8 by default. The Polish alphabet is printed correctly by
	TTF_RenderUTF8_Shaded() both from char arrays and text loaded
	from a file with fgets().
	So shall I store the text in text.c or read it in from
	data/locale/en_GB/text and data/locale/pl/text etc. ?
	English, German, Spanish and Polish would be a good start.
	I've decided to read it from files because languages can be
	added and text changed without recompilation. DONE: Arkadiusz
	is doing the Polish translation. I've half done the German one
	which assisted me in making sure all the text was removed from
	the code and that there was enough space on-screen to write
	something other than English, but from feedback I got from
	Germans I'm not sure that it's really a necessary translation.
	Anyway, I'll leave it in SVN and if a native German speaker
	wants to finish it then I'll add it to the release.
[x] - Add a language selection interface in Options.
	English, German, Polish, Spanish :) (English and Polish first)
[x] - Need to read in multiple lines for the skinrc [about].
[x] - Add a skin selection interface in Options.
[x] - Check the bear start directions on the newly converted packs.
	Should be easy now with ./gnurobbo -800x600 -ts 16 -vpx :D
	[x] - RobboIX
	[x] - RobboVII
	[x] - RobboVIII
[x] - The project would benefit now from being reorganised into more
	files. game.h needs to be seperated into other header files and
	there's now a huge amount of old code marked "Redundant".
[x] - Adjust the yellow colour tile as it's too bright for the GP2X.
[x] - Allow the selection of any resolution via the command line
	whereby the various parts of the program will relocate/resize to
	accommodate them. The game will already easily do this, but the
	intro/help/options I think may need x/yoffset anchor points.
	UPDATE: Any resolution, 16 & 32 field size forcing, centred :)
	Great for getting it running on widescreen devices. Also added
	maximising of the viewport which is great for level designing.
	Try "./gnurobbo -800x600 -ts 16 -vpx" :D Awesome! It's cheating
	of course, that's why I'm not including it in Options.
[x] - Add MECHANIC_SENSIBLE_BEARS and MECHANIC_SENSIBLE_QUESTIONMARKS
	in Options or not? No, not Options, just add them to the rcfile so
	that they can be modified if the user wishes. There may be more
	of these as the project progresses.
[x] - Store the various colours used in global variables which will be
	read from the skinrc. DONE: Colours are read once at the start
	and stored in the skins list.
[x] - Create a dedicated teleport animation instead of using BIG_BOOM.
[x] - Remove the SDL_Delay in the main loop and instead check a flag
	that is cleared by an SDL timer function. Make the game speed
	affect the main loop cycles which will likely mean that the
	object delay defines will need adjusting.
[x] - Add level background colour overrides to the skinrc files. Also
	declare a default level colour and a default pack level colour.
[x] - Reimplementing some functions for making them better and faster.
	Thunor: I've reenginered quite a few functions and the only one
	I haven't touched is update_game. I am familiar with writing
	optimised SDL code and I can run this game on my GP2X at 90MHz
	so I think this can be considered done.
[x] - Port all available levels from Atari
	Thunor: RobboVII to RobboIX are now complete.
[x] - Speed should be configurable from 2 onwards, not 1: 2 to 8 incl.
[x] - End screen (after completing the game)
[x] - Demo mode :) 
[x] - Too much structures (remove something...)
	Thunor: Well I've removed board_copy and I don't see a problem
	with anything else so I guess this qualifies as done :)
[x] - Remove lives from maps and game
[x] - Fine level changing with scrolling effect
[x] - Reconfigurable controls in Options
[x] - Add joystick dead zone to Options
[x] - Save/restore controls to/from rc file
[x] - Tidy-up RobboVIII levels 17 to 24
[x] - Finish porting 8 levels from Robbo VIII
[x] - Sort found level packs
[x] - Show visual indication of Options save
[x] - Scoreline ammo should be 3 digits
[x] - Reposition the scoreline objects
[x] - Implement joystick axes into actions
[x] - Adding the joystick
[x] - Start sequence (needs some moving, help, polishing etc..)
[x] - game objects IDs and icons
[x] - Teleportation
[x] - Moving algorithms for birds
[x] - Moving algorithms for bears (Thanks to Zbigniew Chyla)
[x]	- Moving butterflies
[x]	- Questionmark implementing (needs really random objects generation)
[x]	- Solid laser
[x] - Rotating guns
[x] - Moving guns
[x] - Gun shooting
[x] - Merging all little icons into big one 
[x] - Blasters
[x] - Shooting birds
[x] - Magnets' behaviour
[x] - Score more similar to original game
[x] - GameSaving or codes for planets
[x] - Remember last done level in .gnurobborc file in user home dir
[x] - Energetic barrier
